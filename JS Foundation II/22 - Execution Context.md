# Execution Context

create by parentheses on a function.

```js
function fn() {} // declaration.
fn; // just return the definition.
fn(); // create execution context created by () in javascript engine.
// fn() has been executed in the global execution context. Global()
```

Any time we run code, it's gonna be part of an execution context.
