# Inside the V8 Engine

- Combine Compiler and interpreter => JIT (Just In Time) Compiler
- Profiler: Checking out the code, aka Monitor, watch the code as it runs, and makes notes on how to optimize de code,
  how many times, typings, while the code is running tell the browser what to do, if the same line of code are run a few times, wa pass the code to the compiler.
  so interpreter run the code right the way, profiler and compiler optimze it.
- v8 compilerFan
- Bytecode we need software like virtual machine or JS Engine to execute it directly.
